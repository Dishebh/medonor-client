**Welcome to ME-DONOR_FRONTEND 🚑✌** <br />
Our project aims to counter two problems.<br />

💨one faced by NGO(s) workers searching for particular medicines<br />
💨for donors to look for NGOs eager to use the unused medicienes to distribute among needy people.<br />

It will cut back the need to go to different hospitals/medicine providers for medicines. The shop-vendors/individual can directly learn from the website and contact that person/shop. It makes the process effortless, attracting more people to volunteer for the organization. <br />
